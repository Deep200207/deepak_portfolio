export const HERO_CONTENT = `I'm a passionate Full-Stack Web Developer specializing in the MERN stack — MongoDB, 
    Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. With a strong command of frontend technologies like Tailwind CSS, 
    JavaScript, and HTML, I create responsive and visually appealing user interfaces. On the backend, 
    I build scalable RESTful APIs and manage data effectively using MongoDB. I'm also skilled in Java,
     which strengthens my problem-solving and object-oriented programming capabilities. Whether it's developing 
     a modern UI or building full-stack applications from scratch, I aim to deliver clean, efficient, and maintainable
      code. I'm constantly learning and excited to build innovative solutions for the web`;
export const ABOUT_ME = `I’m Deepak — a tech enthusiast who turned curiosity into code.
    My journey into full-stack development started with small frontend experiments
    and quickly grew into building complete web applications. Today, I work with 
    the MERN stack, combining MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js to build fast 
    and interactive user experiences. I love crafting beautiful UIs with Tailwind
    CSS and solving backend logic with Java and JavaScript. I’m building 
    a project solo or collaborating with a team, I enjoy the process of learning, 
    building, and improving. I’m always excited to take on challenges and bring ideas to life!
